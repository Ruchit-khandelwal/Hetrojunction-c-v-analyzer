#  Welcome to the VLSI C–V Graph Analyzer!

This project is a hands-on tool I built to explore one of the most essential analysis techniques in semiconductor device engineering — **Capacitance–Voltage (C–V) profiling**.

It's a simple Python-based GUI that takes in Excel data and calculates things like:
-  **Built-in potential (Vᵦᵢ)**
-  **Doping concentration (Nᴅ)**
-  C–V characteristics visualized and analyzed

I created this as part of my journey into **VLSI technology**, blending physics with code — and learned a lot in the process.

##  What This Tool Does

- Lets you upload C–V data in `.xlsx` format
- Calculates device physics parameters from scratch
- Shows beautiful graphs and computation steps
- Great for learning, labs, or early-stage research
